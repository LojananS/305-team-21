# 305 Team 21 Mini Project
This is the mini-project repository for COMPSYS305 Team 21.

Our project is to create a Flappy Bird type game which can be played using a PS/2 mouse, DIP switches and push-buttons on a DE0-CV board. The game is to be displayed on a VGA (Video Graphics Array) interface with resolution 640 x 480 pixels. We will display onto a computer monitor through the VGA interface.
